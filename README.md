## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOM



### What I learned

I learnt how to use JavaScript and DOM to select and make changes to elements. I also used the 'focus' css pseudo element for the first time which saved my hours of struggle on changing the background color after a button was selected. Finally, I used the 'addEventListener' procedure to listen to button clicks.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css:focus {
    color:white;
    background-color:hsl(217, 12%, 63%);
}
```



### Continued development

I want to focus on mastering JavaScript more because I've got a lot to learn.
